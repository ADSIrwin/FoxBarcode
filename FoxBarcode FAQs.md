**I can read the images generated by FoxBarcode?**

Yes, with the following readers online:

* [http://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com](http://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com)

**Can you rotate bar codes generated**

Yes, changing the value of the nRotation property. Valid values are: 0 -> 0째, 1 -> 90째, 2 -> 180째 and 3 -> 270째.


**Why the error "OLE error code 0x800A0046"?**

This is a bug in VFP Image object and images different JPG and BMP formats. A workaround is to write the following code in the Destroy method of the Image object:

{{
THIS.PICTURE = ""
}}

**Why does the scanner does not read the code generated by FoxBarcode?**

If printing is not good, increases the value of the nFactor property to 2 or more.

Also make sure the scanner is correctly configured to read the bar code symbology selected.


**The human-readable is not clear**

Use the image format PNG or BMP. Setting the property cImageType = "BMP" or "PNG"


**FoxBarcode Supports QR Code?**

Currently supports the QR Code with the supplement [FoxBarcodeQR](FoxBarcodeQR) which uses the free library BarCodeLibrary.DLL of Dario Aranda  Alvarez (Mexico)
